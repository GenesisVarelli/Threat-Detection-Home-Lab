# Threat Detection Home Lab

## Objective
This project focuses on building a security monitoring lab using Splunk to detect cyber threats. It demonstrates the setup, configuration, and use of Splunk, Zeek, and Suricata IDS for real-time security monitoring and threat detection. Key areas covered include SIEM implementation, IDS deployment, threat hunting, and incident response.

## Skills Learned
- Hands-on experience with Splunk for security monitoring
- Configuring and deploying Zeek and Suricata IDS for network traffic analysis
- Creating SIEM alerts for cyber threat detection
- Investigating security incidents and developing a SOC Playbook
- Understanding log collection, parsing, and analysis for security insights

## Tools Used
- **Splunk** - SIEM for log analysis and threat detection
- **Security Onion** - Network security monitoring
- **Zeek** - Network traffic analysis
- **Suricata IDS** - Intrusion detection system
- **Sysmon** - Windows event logging
- **Winlogbeat** - Log forwarding from Windows to SIEM

## Project Phases

### Phase 1: Home Lab Setup & Configuration
- **Virtual Machine Setup**: Installed VirtualBox
- **Security Tools Installation**: Installed Splunk, Zeek, and Suricata
- **Log Forwarding**: Configured Sysmon and Winlogbeat for Windows event log collection

### Phase 2: SIEM Alerts & Dashboards
- **Brute Force Detection**: Configured SIEM alerts to detect brute force attacks
- **Privilege Escalation Detection**: Set up alerts for privilege escalation attempts
- **Dashboard Creation**: Built dashboards to visualise security events

### Phase 3: Incident Response
- **SOC Playbook**: Documented standard operating procedures for security incidents
- **Incident Reports**: Created reports based on detected security threats
