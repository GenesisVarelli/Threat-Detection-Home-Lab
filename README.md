# Threat Detection Home Lab

## Objective
This project involves building a security monitoring lab to explore threat detection and incident response in a controlled environment. It covers the setup of monitoring systems, log analysis, network visibility, and threat hunting techniques, with a focus on simulating real-world scenarios and improving defensive capabilities.

## Skills Learned
- Gained hands-on experience in security monitoring within a lab environment
- Configured and deployed network traffic analysis tools
- Created alerts and rules for detecting suspicious activity
- Investigated simulated security incidents and developed response procedures
- Explored log collection, parsing, and analysis for threat detection and insights

## Tools Used
- **Splunk** - SIEM for log analysis and threat detection
- **Sysmon** - Windows system monitoring for detailed event logging.
- **Suricata** - Network IDS for threat detection on network traffic.
- **Winlogbeat** - Lightweight agent to ship Windows logs to Splunk.

## Project Phases

### Phase 1: Home Lab Setup & Configuration
- **Virtual Machine Setup**: Installed VirtualBox
- **Security Tools Installation**: Installed Splunk, Zeek, and Suricata
- **Log Forwarding**: Configured Sysmon and Winlogbeat for Windows event log collection

### Phase 2: SIEM Alerts & Dashboards
- **Brute Force Detection**: Configured SIEM alerts to detect brute force attacks
- **Privilege Escalation Detection**: Set up alerts for privilege escalation attempts
- **Dashboard Creation**: Built dashboards to visualise security events

### Phase 3: Incident Response
- **SOC Playbook**: Documented standard operating procedures for security incidents
- **Incident Reports**: Created reports based on detected security threats
